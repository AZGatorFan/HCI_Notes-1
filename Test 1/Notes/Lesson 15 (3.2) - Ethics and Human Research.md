# Lesson 15

In this lesson we will cover the following topics:

1. Origin of research ethics
2. Basic ethical considerations
3. Institutional review board: IRB

## Origin Of Institutional Review Board

Due to unethical experiments such as the _Milgram Experiment_, _Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment_, and _Stanford Prison Experiment_ the _National Research Act_ was enacted (1974). This led to the creation of institutional review boards to oversee research at universities.

In general, the benefits to society must outweigh the risks to the subjects in the case of these experiments.

- **Belmont Report** - summarizes basic ethical principles that research must follow in order to receive government support.
	- demanded rigoruous consent procedures
	- Positive outweighed negatives and rights are always preserved.

## Value of Research Ethics
- Benefits are worth the risk and are significant in nature
- IRB is sensitive about coercision.
- Inherent bias on participants, effect on results.
- Doing good research.
- IRB also monitors the research is sound and useful.

## IRB and its protocols

- Protocol is description of particular research project, procedures IRB as approved. Amendments to protocols.
- We are added to exisiting protocol.

## IRB Protocol
- Add research personel
- Protocol title
- select role
- Certification is needed
- PI will be always first
- How to create a protocol in IRBWISE
	- protocol description covers study at high level.
	- Research design and methodology 
	- Experimental designs
	- duration of participation
	- Data collection methods
	- benefits outweigh the risk
	- Risks are to be added.
	- Statistical Analysis
	- Start and End dates

## Human Subject Interaction details

- Will directly involve direct interaction
- describe subjects and data
- Vulnerable population - special accomodation is to be needed
- Scientific justification is needed
- Effect size is needed
- Inclusion and Exclusion status
- Subjects age ranges
- Recruitment plan - Subject pool
- Compensation provision


## IRB Consent Procedure
- What kind of consent is received? Written or Waiver
	- Some narrow circumstances - Now direct effect
- Waiver of documentation of consent
	- Written consent is only identity of participant
	- Implied consent and can withdraw anytime
- Justtification is needed for consent waiver
- At risk population needs more information
- Concealment, deception - Temporary prototype is needed

## Data Management Question
- Clinical research and Biological research
- How to we keep data safe
- DoD, Radiation and Nano tech - Involvement
- interview script, recruitment script, survey etc.
- No conflict of Interest and submit to PI.

## Research ethics and Industry
- Rapid A/B Experiments
- Wont pass IRB and Facebook
- Facebook manipulate users
	- data use policy
	- Not informed consent

### Exercise: Research Ethics and Industry

_People are still discussing whether or not Facebook's study on its impact on users' moods was ethical. Facebook maintains that the study was consistent with its own data use policy. However, opponents argue that Facebook's study was not. What do you think?_

It may be ethical in the sense that the study was not conducted under an institution which requires informed consent. However, I do think that Facebook needs to do a better job at terms and conditions and allowing users to be informed about the research they are doing rather than using content to manipulate users.
